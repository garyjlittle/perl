Some Example Perl Scripts - hosted on github

## Use cases.
Think of perl as a better bash+awk rather than as a general purpose programming language like python. The power of perl is in the defaults/special shortcuts that enable parsing text without writing a lot of code/keystrokes.

hello_world.pl - Hello World

* Use #!/usr/bin/env perl - To get latest perl in $PATH
* Use "my $varname" to avoid namespace clashes
* Use "return $var" in functions to enforce proper returns.
* Use "perl -w" - To enable warnings
* Use "use strict" to enforce sane programming like not allowing global vars in functions by accident.
